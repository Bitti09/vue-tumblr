# Vue -Tumblr

A small Tumblr Viewer based on Vue with ant Design

## Requirements

Tumblr api -> graphql Server ( will upload my little script later)

## Information:

* There is **NO** NSFW filter currently in my app.
* Tag search is not and probably won't be included due to the heavy limited tag api.
* Currently supported Post types: - Photo - Video

## ToDo

* Ui optimization
* i18n support
* Adding support for more Post types
